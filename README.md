# lane-detection
Project 1 in Udacity self-driving car nanodegree: detect continuous lines that represent lanes.

## Setup

Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md) to set up Anaconda environment. You can verify that your environment is set up correctly using the instructions [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit-Test).

## Files
* P1.ipynp - Jupyter notebook with the code.
* writeup.md - description of lane line detection pipeline and algorithms.
* writeup_images - folder of images used to illustrate our algorithms.
* test_images - folder of test images, provided by Udacity.
* test_images_output - folder of test images with detected line segments, created by the code in P1.ipynb.
* test_videos - folder of test videos, provided by Udacity.
* test_videos_output - folder of test videos with detected lane lines, created by the code in P1.ipynb.
* examples - folder of example images, provided by Udacity.

## Usage
After setting up the environment, open P1.ipynb in Jupyter notebook and run all the cells.
